Can I noarch *everything*?

Does not support Windows:
- uvloop
  - Windows explicitly prohibited in setup.py
- gunicorn
  - requires 'fcntrl' which is Unix-only
- airflow
  - depends on gunicorn
- jq.py, pyjq
  - aka "jq" on PyPI but the name is already taken by jq itself
  - jq itself is unavailable on Windows

Fails for other reasons:
- distance
  - fails due to some file not found? idk why

vim: shiftwidth=2 expandtab
